# Metaveral Fatigue Detection

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Metaverse is getting adopted without effective rules and regulation, prolonged usage tech/devices may have side effects for human, tech-nological fatigue is one of the key side-effects. This project is aimed to warn user about the fatique and side-effect beyond a limit. Aims to build such out of the box capability within the future metaverse devices.   


## Background
Metaverse is the [next Internet](https://thinkuldeep.com/post/getting-into-the-metaverse-part-1/). Metaverse as a trillion dollar opportunity in the next few years. It is growing at real fast speed, but without effective rules and regulations, without effective standards and practices,so with great [usacases it also comes with concerns](https://thinkuldeep.com/post/getting-into-the-metaverse-part-2/).

Proloned usage of metaversal devices may have health imapact, and technolgical fatigue is quite common in pandamic/post-pendamic era. Detecting the fatigue and then warning users will be really important for ethical adaoption of the technology. Infact, this has to be out of the box feature in metaversal device/headset/eye/head worn devices.


## How is it used?

Most metaversal devices such has AR/VR headset/smartglass have capabilites of eye tracking, guestures detection, head movement, body tracking, environment detection, blood-pressure, heartbeat, and more. Even EEG could also be read with BCI and all. 

With all this data, patterns of fatigue could be determized and upon fatique detection the deices could alert users, and ask them to take rest, and stay away for some time, resume after some time. 


## Data sources and AI methods
It would need data gethered from device sensors and fatigue analysis. Would need more controlled experiments. There are some examples for general use using mobile phones eg. - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269983794_Fatigue_Detection_using_Smartphones 

It will be more need in metaverse.

## Challenges
Getting right data is a challenge, and not all XR (ARVR) devices are capable of all this, putting such solutions within these devices are battery draining and have impacts on the usage of these. 
with 5G/6G adaption we could move to cloud based rendering could be solution.    


## What next?
Request the community to participate and build more on this line. I will share more on this.
